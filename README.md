[Bad Bank App]


## Description

This is a project we worked on during MIT xPRO's Full Stack Web Development porgram. It's called bad bank since it has no real security but we are refactoring it to include authentication and authorization. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
